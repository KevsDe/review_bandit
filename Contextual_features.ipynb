    "<p>The sample has been pre-processed on behavioural features, so I can proceed to evaluate the contextual features, almost all of the variables are pretty similar, as exceptions, the readability for low-quality reviews is \"very easy\" and for the good quality reviews is \"standard\", there is a big gap in the average number of words that makes sense because the fake reviews don´t provide relevant information, and lots of them are simple copy-paste, on the other hand, the grammatical mistakes probably are correlated with longer reviews.  There are other parameters that are not as expected for example the verbs and nouns ratio, but since lots of fake reviews are guided, that parameters don´t seem relevant, indeed are very similar,  subjectivity is kind of similar and the polarity as expected is higher in low-quality reviews, as most of them are 5 stars reviews suggesting that the product is \"awesome\", \"great\", \"amazing\", etc. Seems that our dataset is well balanced and has certain reliability. </p>"
